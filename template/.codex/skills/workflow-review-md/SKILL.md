description: Review current code changes against `.ai-workflow/GOAL.md`, `.ai-workflow/PLAN.md`, `.ai-workflow/ACCEPTANCE.md`, `.ai-workflow/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`, the actual git diff, and available validation results, then draft `.ai-workflow/REVIEW.md` with `passed` or `changes_requested`, blocking findings, non-blocking suggestions, missing tests, and rationale that an implementation model can act on. Use when the user wants Codex to act as the review gate in a Codex to pi workflow. Default to review and quality control; if the user explicitly asks Codex to implement code, Codex may switch to coding after completing or superseding the review task.

# Workflow Review Md

Generate a review artifact that pi can consume for the next fix cycle.

## Review inputs

Prioritize these inputs:

1. `.ai-workflow/PLAN.md`
2. `.ai-workflow/GOAL.md`
3. `.ai-workflow/ACCEPTANCE.md`
4. `.ai-workflow/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`
5. `git diff` or equivalent actual code changes
6. key changed files
7. available test or verification results

If some inputs are missing, state what is missing and review with the available evidence.

## Workflow file mode

Use `.ai-workflow` in current-task overwrite mode unless the user explicitly asks for task-specific archival.

Treat:
- `.ai-workflow/GOAL.md`
- `.ai-workflow/PLAN.md`
- `.ai-workflow/ACCEPTANCE.md`
- `.ai-workflow/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`
- `.ai-workflow/REVIEW.md`

as the files for the current active task.

When preparing a new review artifact for the current task, prefer replacing stale review content rather than appending multiple unrelated task reviews into the same file.

## Core behavior

1. Review the actual changes, not just the implementation narrative.
2. Judge whether the implementation matches the plan and satisfies acceptance criteria.
3. Focus on:
   - correctness
   - behavioral regressions
   - missing validation
   - scope drift
   - risky omissions
   - unnecessary abstraction or overengineering
   - deployment or operational risk introduced by the change
4. Prefer specific, actionable findings over generic style advice.
5. Explain why each blocking finding matters so the implementation model does not need to infer reviewer intent.

## Required output

Always return output in this shape unless the user explicitly asks for a different format:

## REVIEW.md
```md

## Review rules

- Set status to `changes_requested` if there is any issue that should block completion, commit, or merge.
- Set status to `passed` only when there are no blocking findings.
- If there are no items for a section, write `None`.
- For a new review cycle on the same active task, overwrite `.ai-workflow/REVIEW.md` with the latest authoritative review state unless the user explicitly asks to preserve historical iterations in the same file.
- Tie findings to concrete files, behaviors, or validation gaps whenever possible.
- Avoid rewriting the implementation plan unless the existing implementation clearly invalidates it.
- Do not dilute blocking issues with broad "nice to have" commentary.
- Include enough background and rationale that a weaker implementation model can execute fixes correctly without reconstructing context from scratch.

## Severity guidance

- Treat as blocking:
  - wrong behavior
  - likely regressions
  - incomplete implementation against plan
  - missing critical tests or validation
  - dangerous edge cases that should be fixed now
  - scope drift that makes the change harder to maintain or deploy
  - speculative abstractions that add complexity without current-task justification
- Treat as non-blocking:
  - cleanup ideas
  - maintainability improvements that do not affect correctness today
  - optional follow-up hardening

## Quality lens

Evaluate whether the implementation is:

- engineering-oriented rather than patchy
- robust under edge cases that are reasonable for the task
- elegant through simplicity, not cleverness
- extensible only where the current scope actually demands it
- covered by targeted regression tests
- safe to run, start, and deploy within the affected workflow

## Final response format

At the end, respond in Chinese with exactly these top-level sections:

```md
## 工作流结果
- 技能: `workflow-review-md`
- 状态: `passed` | `changes_requested`
- 产物: `REVIEW.md`

## 审查摘要
- 背景: ...
- 结论: ...
- 阻塞项: ...
- 缺失验证: ...

## 下一步
- ...
```

## Role boundary

- Default role: review and quality gate.
- This is not a hard prohibition on coding.
- If the user explicitly asks Codex to modify code, Codex may do so, but should be clear that it is switching from review mode into implementation mode.
